	<h2>HyperX Alloy Origins 60</h2>

<p style="color: magenta">One of the biggest crazes in mechanical keyboards over the last 12 months has been the rise of so-called 60 percent form factors. The design not only omits the number pad but the function row, macros, and arrow keys as well to make one of the smallest and most compact solutions for your desk.

HyperX teamed up with Ducky a few months ago for a limited-edition 60 percent design, but now HyperX is back with a non-limited edition featuring for the first time its own Red linear mechanical switches.

The $99 HyperX Alloy Origins 60 is now available for purchase, and I have been using it for the last few weeks. Here's what you need to know.<font size="4">

<h2>HyperX Pulsefire Haste Wireless Gaming Mouse - White</h2><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hyperx-pulsefire-haste-wireless-gaming-mouse-%28white%29"></a>

<p style="color: magenta">The HyperX Pulsefire Haste Wireless Gaming Mouse packs in all the best features of the ultra-lightweight Pulsefire Haste plus a wireless connection and long-lasting battery life, but only adds a mere 2g of additional weight[1]. If you’ve been hesitant to cut the mouse cord, fear not, as the Pulsefire Haste’s 1ms report rate and 2.4GHz signal provides a low-latency wireless connection that meets the demands of elite players. Not only that, but with up to 100 hours of battery life[2], you’ll get over 4 full days of clicking on heads from a single charge of your honeycomb mouse. With a responsive, split-button design, you won’t have to worry about missed clicks, as the satisfying, tactile TTC Golden micro switches are rated for up to 80 million clicks. If you prefer a cable, HyperX also includes a HyperFlex cable which teams up with the virgin-grade PTFE skates to deliver a smooth, easy glide.<font size="4">
